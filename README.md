# OmniChain - visual logic chains that guide, control, and empower AI models to think, act, and remember things any way you want

![Screenshot](/screenshot.png)

-   Build powerful custom workflows with AI language models doing all the heavy lifting, guided by your own logic process, for a drastic improvement in efficiency.
-   Use the chain's memory abilities to store and recall information, and make decisions based on that information. You read that right, the chains can learn!
-   Squeeze more power out of smaller models by guiding them through a specific process, like a train on rails, even giving them hints along the way, resulting in much more efficient and cost-friendly logic.
-   Access the underlying operating system to read/write files, and run commands.
-   Have the model generate and run NodeJS code snippets, or even entire scripts, to use APIs, automate tasks, and more, harnessing the full power of your system.
-   Create custom agents and regular logic chains wired up together in a single workflow to create efficient and flexible automations.
-   Attach your creations to any existing framework (agentic or otherwise) via the OpenAI-format API, to empower and control its thought processes better than ever!
-   Private (self-hosted), fully open-source, and available for commercial use via the non-restrictive MIT license.
-   No coding skills required!
