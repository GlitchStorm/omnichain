# OmniChain - visual logic chains that guide, control, and empower LLMs to think, act, and remember things any way you want

![Screenshot](/screenshot.png)

-   Build powerful custom workflows with LLMs doing all the heavy lifting, to create a more effective LLM experience.
-   Use the chain's memory abilities to store and recall information, and make decisions based on that information.
-   Create custom agents and regular logic chains wired together in a single workflow to create powerful and flexible systems.
-   Give the LLM access to the underlying operating system to read/write files, and run commands.
-   Have the LLM generate and run NodeJS code snippets, or even entire scripts, to use APIs, automate tasks, and more.
-   Attach your creations to any existing framework (agentic or otherwise) via the OpenAI-compatible API, to empower and control its thought processes better than you ever could before.
-   No coding skills required!
